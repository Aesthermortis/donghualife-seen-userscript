# DonghuaLife Seen Userscript

Mark episodes as **seen** on [donghualife](https://donghualife.com) with a simple and persistent toggle.
Designed for a smooth experience, compatible across browsers and userscript managers.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Mark as Seen** button on episode cards.
- 🗂️ **IndexedDB storage**: scalable and responsive, even with hundreds of episodes.
- ⚡ **Fast & asynchronous**: non-blocking operations using `async/await`.
- 🖥️ **Floating settings menu**: configure options without relying on Tampermonkey-only APIs.
- ♿ **Accessibility**: `aria` attributes and improved focus/contrast.
- 🔄 **Automatic detection**: new episodes detected via `MutationObserver`.

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
